# FlashCards

## Abstract

The "Flashcards" project is the first assignment of Module 2 for the 1903 FEE Cohort at the Turing School of Software and Design. Using Javascript through the Terminal and the Commandline Interface, we were tasked with creating a flashcard game that creates cards, stores decks, initiates rounds, records turns, and returns your overall statistics. 

## Install and Setup

Fork the 'flashcards-starter' repository from GitHub, and clone down the forked repo using 

```bash
git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]
```

Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```

To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm test` in your terminal.

Running `node index.js` from the root of your project should result in the following message being displayed in your terminal: 

```bash
Node server running on port 3000
```
