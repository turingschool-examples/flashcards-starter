# Flashcards

## About

FlashCards is a study application that is played using basic keyboard controls through the command line interface. The app presents coding-related study questions to the user, prompting user to select one of three multiple choice options. Once selection is made, feedback is given indicating whether the question was answered correctly, as well as a percentage of correctly answered questions once user had gone through all 30 questions.
