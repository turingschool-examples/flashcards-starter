## Context:

This project was completed as Turing School of Software and Design’s first solo project for module two. In the FlashCard project it is the first time we have experienced writing tests for ourselves. This project took me about 6 hours.

## Learning Goals:

For the FlashCard projects we were expected to contribute code to a partially constructed object-oriented application. We should be able to follow the spec to make a working application
while also implementing ES6 classes. I also needed to be able to write modular, reusable code that follows SRP and also implementing a robust testing suite using TDD.
<br>
<br>
## Technologies Used:

This application was written 100% in JavaScript and used the Mocha and Chai testing libraries.
