# FlashCards - A Terminal Quiz Game

## Abstract
In this project, we were tasked with building out a CLI (Command-Line-Interface) program that simulates quizing a user through a set of flash cards.

A user can see the questions, take their guess, receive immediate answer feedback, and lastly view their final score at the end of the round.

## In Action

Run `node index.js` to fire up the game.

Follow the question prompts to begin completing the quiz.

## Learning Goals
	- Contribute code to a partially constructed object-oriented application
	- Follow spec/prompts to make a working application
	- Implement ES6 classes
	- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
	- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD

	### Wins
		- Gaining more familiarity with Chai assertion library in the test suite.
		- Building an object-orientated application. I'm happy with the strides in Class organization I made in this project.

	### Challenges
		- Ran out of time to further refine the testing suite. Meant to write more "sad path" tests on the Round class, but ultimately did not have enough time.
		- Slow start; difficult to conceptualize what the data manipulation goals were without a user interface to easily visualize the JavaScript logic in action.
