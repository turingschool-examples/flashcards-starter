## Learning Goals
- Contribute code to an partially constructed application
- Follow spec/prompts to make a working application
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
## Wins + Challenges
Wins:
- Learned how to write test suites using Mocha and Chai

Challenges:
- Writing test suites for the first time
- using arrow functions for the first time

I overcame these challenges by doing a lot of research and self-teaching, and reaching out to my cohort mates when I needed help
