# FlashCards

### Abstract:

This application runs a game in the console that asks questions about javasript and returns correct or incorrect. There are 30 questions and at the end of the test your time elapsed and percent correct are displayed. You will be prompted for each question, have the opportunity to select an answer, and will be given feedback. You will be able to play through the entire deck of cards.

### Installation Instruction

1. Fork and clone this repo.
2. Type `cd flashcards` to move into the root directory
3. run `npm install` to install the library dependencies
4. Run `code .` to open vs code to access the files
5. Run `node index.js` to play the game on the console

To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm test` in your terminal. You should have 18 tests passing.

### How to View Your Code in Action

Once you are working through Iteration 3, you will want to run the `node index.js` command in your terminal to run the game.

When the game is functioning appropriately, you will be prompted for each question, have the opportunity to select an answer, and will be given feedback. You will be able to play through the entire deck of cards:

### context:

This project took me 3 days to complete, I am currently in week 1 of mod2 at Turing.

### contributors:

Ben Holden, Turing staff(partially created project).

### Learning Goals: 

The learning goals of this project were to write unit tests and functions to create a game in the console and to link js files together for seamless interoperability.

### Wins + Challenges:

Wins: during this challenge all i knew how to do in the beggining was how to read tests, after using my knowledge of how the tests were usually set up i was able to create tests and then write my functions just like it was a blueprint.

challenges: I had no idea how to link together js files until i did some research and tried out new things on my code and i was able to work around all the issues i was having be reading my error messages and slowly getting the files to link with eachother.
