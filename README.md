# Flashcards

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
This app allows the user to use virtual flashcards in order to study topics related to prototype methods in Javascript and it runs entirely in the console. Once the user answers all questions, they are provided a score and then prompted to answer any questions that they originally answered incorrectly.

### Installation Instructions:

1. Fork the `flashcards` repository
2. Clone down your new, forked repo
3. In the terminal cd into the repository
4. Open it in your text editor to view the code
5. Start the test by running node index.js in your terminal
