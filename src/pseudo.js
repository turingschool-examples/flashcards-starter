//ITERATION 1
// createCard function
// evaluateGuess, see if it matches with answer
// return incorrect or correct

//ITERATION 2
//=====DECK=========
//The deck object should be created with an array of card objects.
//The deck object should know how many cards are in the deck
/*What - what data do I have?
//createDeck function
// deck will be an object with key:value pairs
    //deck - has the array of cards (card1, card2, card3)
    //deckLength - gives us the number of cards by determining the length of the cards array

//*Want - what do I want to do with that data?
    //return the array of cards
    //return the length of the array of cards

//*How - How will I make this happen?

//*Methods - What methods will I need to make that happen?
    //use the .length() to get the array length  */

//========ROUND========
//The round object should organize guesses
//and record if the guess was correct or incorrect
//createRound function - should create an object
//key:value pairs to include:
//deck: deckObj
//currentCard: deckObj.deck[1]
//turns: 0 (will need to add on to this)
//incorrectGuesses: [] (starts as empty, fills with id's of cards from incorrect guesses)
//

//*What - what data do I have?
//*Want - what do I want/need to do with that data?
//*How - How will I make that happen?
//*Methods - What methods will I need to make that happen?

// takeTurn to increment turns, evaluates guesses, gives feedback and stores id of incorrect guesses

// calculatePercentCorrect(round) calculates and returns the percentage of correct guesses

//endRound(round) prints Round over! You answered ### of the questions correctly
